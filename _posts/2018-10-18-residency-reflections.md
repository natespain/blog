The first residency at VCFA was an overwhelming experience. I met some extraordinary people, and took in a large amount of information that I feel like I'm still trying to sort through. In all of this activity there were a few key ideas that I took away from my first experience in Montpelier.

The first major takeaway was the idea of the designer as content creator. After working for years in an industry where everything I created was for a client, it's difficult for me to imagine creating my own content and designing it. On the surface it seems so obvious, but after years of conditioning requiring me to put the client needs first, this is a breath of fresh air and also a big challenge.

The wide open scope of this new frontier is a bit daunting, and my old brain has to have some parameters to work inside, or I may grind to a halt in production out of being overwhelmed. That leads me to the second big idea that I gained from the residency. Work on what you're interested in. I've always been interested in architectureâ€”specifically arts and crafts, modernism and the international style, as well as contemporary ideas. I was encouraged to think down this path and landed on the idea of chairs as a subject of focus. Many major architects designed chairs as a way to express their views on architecture. It seems like an appropriate gateway to study modernism, architecture, designers, and their ideals. This is one thing I did not expect to walk away with after my week in Vermont.

The last important element that I took away with me was the practice of documentation. This is another one that may seem obvious after saying it out loud, but I think I just take for granted all of the work I produce on a daily basis. I intend to document all of my activities by writing about them, photographing them, and creating work around them. My first attempt at documentation was a card deck that I created based off of my notes from the week at VCFA. It turned out to be an effective exercise in gathering my thoughts and breaking down key and memorable moments of my time there.

I've never really approached anything in this way before, but I hope that it helps me develop a practice of research, documentation and making that lasts far longer than my time at graduate school.
