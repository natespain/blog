I spent the majority of my second month creating assets based on the general idea that I would be utilizing my sketches of chairs for larger pieces and experiments in the future. Before moving on to bigger and broader concepts, I wanted to close the book—or at least put a bookmark in—the multi-color chair poster that I had been experimenting with. The one idea that I was struggling with was the 4-up chair composition that I started to think about after the single Jacobsen Egg chair poster was created. 

There are a few issues I have with this composition. The main problem is that I think the visual is much more powerful than the single chair. There is a dynamism that exists that just isn't present in the original poster, but unfortunately I had not resolved the 'why' behind it. An argument can be made that there doesn't need to be a 'why', but I don't buy it. When the entire thought of the piece is based around experimenting with process and also mixing it with the idea of modernism, I can't cop out in the final stage and just say "I like the way this looks better". Man, that just feels lazy.  

Technically, there is also an issue with the experimentation in the process as well. The whole idea originally was to make a single screen and create a 4-color composition out of it using the squares in the corner as registration marks. The 4-up composition isn't as straight forward. The logical way to execute this would be to create 4 separate screens (1 for each color) and print it in a standard format. This, however defeats the initial idea of the experiment.

And finally, the last issue I have is the 'why' behind the shifting of the screens. Why am I printing the four screens in the patterns I'm choosing. The truth is that it was random. Kind of and order to chaos motif—but that's even pretty loose. It's been hard to imaging making this an edition without resolving these issues—and I really want to make an edition.

An excerpt from “the abc’s of [triangle, square,
circle]: the bauhaus and design theory” monograph changed things.

>In 1923 Kandinsky proposed a universal correspondence between the three elementary shapes and the three primary colors: the dynamic triangle is inherently yellow, the static square is intrinsically red, and the serene circle is naturally blue. Today, the equation of the three shapes has lost its claim to universality and works instead as a floating sign capable of assuming numerous meanings. Among them is the memory it recalls of the Bauhaus.

This thought locked everything into place. The patterns of the registration marks are now following the basic geometric shapes of the triangle, square, and circle. The shapes of the marks themselves follow suit just to make the connection clear. This helps the piece tie itself even more to the Modernist ideals, at the same time giving a purpose to the pattern. Also, process experimentation can still exist in the fact that a single, smaller, screen will be used to print each color of each chair. The squeegee will be pulled a total of sixteen times for one composition. I'm intentionally making this complex in hopes of forcing some happy accidents to occur. Also, it will hopefully instill a reverence for the object in that is being printed just in the mere presence and time it took to create the print.
