That's right, chairs. This semester, my plan is to study them. How do we use them? Why does every architect (it seems) design one? What is their history, and where do they fit in today?

I have always had a deep seated love for architecture that goes back to early teenage years. Frank Lloyd Wright's designs were some of the first things I can remember being interested in, and I still remember the dining room chairs in his Oak Park home—the ones with the really straight backs that look so beautiful, but horribly uncomfortable. I didn't know it then, but that was my first foray into this topic. A seemingly innocuous piece of furniture defining how the space was going to be used. In this case, I suppose Mr. Wright didn't want people to spend a lot of time eating? In any case, this was not the beginning of architects designing chairs nor was it the end by far.

I'm going to focus my attention on modernist designers, but I'll begin by doing a cursory historical study of the humble seat. I'll be sure to post any work that I do that's based off of this idea, so stay tuned for some interesting takes on how this object has evolved and been interpreted over time.
