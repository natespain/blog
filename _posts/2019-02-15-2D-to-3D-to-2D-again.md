When I was in college I moved around a lot—not an atypical situation for someone at that age. The one thing I was really tired of though, was the act of moving. Lugging in beds and desks and tables was no fun, and frankly the furniture that I had at the time could only withstand a couple of those moves before it had to be replaced. 

One summer when I was home, I took advantage of my dad's workshop and made a few key pieces of furniture out of wood. The defining characteristics of these were that they were sturdy and could also be disassembled and reassembled with ease—thus reducing the issue of them falling part as they were moving from place to place. Fast forward a couple of decades and I find myself reflecting on that time as I work on my recent project: the design and construction of a chair.

I've assigned myself the same constraints that I had as a student as I've been thinking about how to piece this chair together. Maybe even more so, as I want to be able to design something that is shippable via the mail service, and also can be assembled without tools. I've been using a Glowforge laser cutter to iterate small prototypes in hopes of eventually creating a human scaled version. My general thought behind this is simple. If I can successfully execute a miniature chair using flat pieces of 1/8" plywood on the Glowforge, there doesn't seem to be a reason that the idea would not work with 1/2" plywood in the full sized version. It has been in interesting exploration in wood joints, laser cut living hinges and a utilization of modern and classic woodworking techniques to bring this idea to life. 

Here are some images of my latest iterations of the idea. I'll post more as the project grows in scale.
