I decided to give myself a breather for the week after my first residency. One, so that I could recover from a chest cold that I developed when I was in New England, and two so that I could spend some time preparing the spaces and file structures that I intended to work in during my first six months.

I determined that I would have two different desk environments to work. One at home and one in my office at school. The one at home is for convenience mainly - to have a space in my house that is dedicated to work. My office at school is the home base for my studio practice. I intend to create a good deal of analog work this semester through traditional printing practices as well as other mixed media, and I need the studio spaces at school to be able to have the space to do this. Therefore, my office at school should be equipped to handle my work on the days that I need to be away from home. This multi-office situation basically just means that my laptop needs to be location agnostic.

Location agnostic—all that really means in the context of my laptop is that I need to be able to access my work from whatever location that I decide to land in. To do this, I have made all of my files available in Dropbox, sot hat they can be accessed from anywhere. In an attempt to make the workspaces as similar as possible, I've set up a monitor in both locations with the same keyboard and trackpad. This way, I don't have to rethink how to work with my computer because of the space I decide to land in that day.

The printing studio at my school, and the design studios offer plenty of table space to spread out and work. I intend to do any major printing—either by hand of from inkjet printers—from these spaces and store the finished pieces in my office at school.

The other major preparation from this week was setting up a template file for my monthly packets. I created an 8"x10" 5-column grid layout based off a Mark Rothko book that I thought had a well proportioned layout that was successful fro displaying text was well as artwork. This is what I will format all of my packets in. At the end of the semester I'll combine them and have them printed as one book through Blurb.com.

Finally, I set up a new Jekyll powered blog to keep track of my daily writings. These will most likely all end up in the packet, but I wanted to create a space online that not only was an offsite backup of my work (I'm a nerd), but also gave me a publishing platform that I could keep building on over time.

The one other activity that I plan on doing over the semester is reading—a lot. This really can be done anywhere, but I've made sure that my home studio has an abundance of natural light so that it would entice me to use the space for research as well as making.

I guess that's it. No more reasons to delay. I'll start creating some new material this week. Test.
