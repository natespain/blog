There was a quote by Martin Greif in the book I'm reading, American Modernism by R. Roger Remington, about America in the 1930s, it reads:

>"Some sang cynically of paper moons and cardboard seas, other dreamed, optimistically, of an American era in which everyone, rich and poor alike, would share in the material riches of the nation—of a time in which all Americans would own a multitude of simple, useful, beautiful objets bought in stores created consciously as a golden mean between the five-and-dime and Tiffany's."

This struck me when I read it, as it plays into an idea I've been thinking about in terms of furniture. The main gist is that many of the chairs (and other pieces) that were designed by the architects and designers of the 30s through the 50s were made to be mass produced and therefore available to everyone. The irony is that now, those same pieces of furniture are out of most middle class family's price range due to their iconic status—essentially negating the reason they were designed in the first place.

This quote speaks to a similar situation in which there were good intentions initially, but things don't always go as expected. I think about consumer culture and how far overboard we have gone with the notion that "all Americans would own a multitude of...beautiful objects" that sit in the middle between cheap and expensive. It amazed me how the idea of design has been taken out of the equation and the cost-per-product is more front and center—not to mention the margin of profit for the manufacturer. I don't think the Walmart (or even Target) culture is what Greif had in mind when he said this.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not necessarily trying to put another negative article about big box stores out into the world, it is just really interesting to me how the best of intentions went so awry. I guess a good takeaway is to just be aware that history shows most things will not go as planned, no matter how idealistic the initial thought, when there is money to be made. Unless, of course, the original plan is to make money.
