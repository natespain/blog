So I've been struggling with this chair idea (see [this post] (/posts/chairs) for details). My first design project having to do with the topic was supposed to be a 'chair timeline'. It seems simple enough on the surface, but man, it's been tough to think about. Should I start with modernism, because that's where I think my interests lie? Should I start at the beginning of time - human's sitting on rocks before they even discover fire? This seems to be the most logical. Humans moving from rocks to straw to stools to chairs. But I feel like it's almost too broad. It would take way more than six months to explore that as deep as I would like. So, I've decided to lean into my interests. I have a Taschen book called "[1000 chairs](https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/architecture/all/49357/facts.1000_chairs_revised_and_updated_edition.htm?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpLixrrqg3gIVTFcMCh1uoALQEAQYASABEgJdiPD_BwE)", and I've decided to start there.

Flipping though, I've found some really interesting stuff. Chairs from ancient Egypt that are beautiful, chairs from the 19th century that look like they could be made now, and the usual suspects from the middle of the 20th century that I would feel as if I've missed out on something big if they weren't included in my findings. I'm going to approach this thing in a non-linear fashion. Dive into chairs that I find interesting, research them, then produce a reflection on each one. A timeline can start to form after that. But instead of a timeline of chairs in general, it's more just a list of chairs that I like and that have been influential in the field of modern design. I'll compile my research for each one in the form of a zine and create design work around my discoveries with each one. I'll explore printing techniques, drawing techniques and other mixed media to produce a body of work that is hopefully as rich as the pieces that I'm researching. 

Here's to a decision having been made.
