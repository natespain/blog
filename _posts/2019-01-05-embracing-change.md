The expansion of graphic design from a craft to a method of thought is what R. Roger Remington seems to think sums up the progression of the field in the 1940s. The idea that the decade was a critical juncture in where the avant guard influences of the 1930s were combined with business thinking really hits home. One quote really stood out to me in this portion of Remington's book. It said that the emerging role of the graphic designer was that of

>"A conceptual problem-solver who engaged in the total design of the space, orchestrating words, signs, symbols and images, into a communicative entity".

For as long as I have been involved in the graphic design industry, the one thing that has stayed consistent is how often things change. From tools, to trends, to ideas—it seems as if the designer is constantly learning new things and at time reinventing themselves. It's interesting how the tools or technologies of the moment can sometimes overshadow the core or purpose of the job itself.  

The thoughts above make me consider that the graphic design profession is not necessarily always changing, but more that the rate of change is part of the scope—and will always be part of the definition of the profession. The total design of the space or the 'total work of art' is always what the graphic designer is after, no matter what tools or skills are required to make it happen. The basic tenets of the craft are still important: typography, layout, and so on. It's just that now, designers are using newer technologies to implement them.

All of this reiterates what I try to teach, and that is that the two most important tools in a designer's toolbox are curiosity and the ability to embrace change. Change is inevitable, and curiosity is required to know what changes are happening.
