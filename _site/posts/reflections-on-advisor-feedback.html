<section class="single">

	<p>I was relieved that my initial packet was considered a success. I was happy with the material I submitted but I was concerned that it may not be ‘enough’ or up to expectations—but it seems I was worried fo uno reason. The initial month was a bit of a blur as I found my way, but I think I have a much clearer direction in mind after speaking with Silas about where I am.</p>

<p>It’s never been unknown to me how architecture coincides directly with graphic design, but the more I dive into modernism and the study of chairs, the more I realize how much everything is tied together. This month I’m going to try to keep reading Remington’s book on American Modernism, but I’m also going to try to dive a little deeper into architects that have clear internal logic in their work. I want to wrap my head around this concept more and explore the idea of developing a method for my work in general. I really am attracted to the idea that a method or a way of thinking about graphic design could be applied to everything I do. It’s interesting for me to think about it as something to develop for a potential thesis and even something I can continue indefinitely.</p>

<p>The next pieces of work I’m going to focus on are the continuation of my studies of chairs. I plan adding many more drawings to the collection, and adding to the timeline that was started in the first packet. I also intend to print the 4-up deconstructed chair screen prints in order to complete that thought. I hope that may help lead to other avenues of creating. But for now, I’m going to try to focus on quantity. Beefing up my collection of assets seems like a good idea right now—I have a feeling I may use them for future work as well.</p>

<p>An intriguing thought that came out my advisor meeting was how architecture informs graphic design and design has started to inform architecture. This is an idea I’d like to begin exploring and maybe finding key points in time or even key architects and designers where this occurs regularly. This will definitely eventually pulse out of the modernism timeline, so I’ll try to start there first before swimming into the future.</p>

<p>One step at a time. Overall, I’m going to keep going down the same path of exploration, but I have new things to think about as I go.</p>
